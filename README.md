# AnagramGenerator

Run anagram.py and enter letters to search for when prompted. Type exit/reset on any of the prompts for letters to exit or reset the program.

The base dictionary can be easily swapped out. Currently the program is using enable1.txt (from https://github.com/dolph/dictionary) as its dictionary.
